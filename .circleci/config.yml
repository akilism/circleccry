# we now have TWO jobs, so that a workflow can coordinate them!
jobs: 
 # This is our first job.
  one:
  # it uses the docker executors
    docker: 
      - image: circleci/ruby:2.4.1 # specifically, a docker image with ruby 2.4.1
    # Steps are a list of commands to run inside the docker container above.
    steps:
      - checkout # this pulls pulls code down from GitHub
      - run: echo "A first hello" # This prints "A first hello" to stdout.
      - run: sleep 25 # a command telling the job to "sleep" for 25 seconds.
  # This is our second job.
  two: 
  # it runs inside a docker image, the same as above.
      docker: 
        - image: circleci/ruby:2.4.1
      steps:
        - checkout
        - run: echo "A more familiar hi" # We run a similar echo command to above.
        - run: sleep 15 # and then sleep for 15 seconds.
# Under the workflows: map, we can coordinate our two jobs, defined above.
